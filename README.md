# Tic-Tac-Toe Game  

Welcome to my first Tic-Tac-Toe game! ðŸŽ®  

## **About**  
This is a simple and fun Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Test your skills against an opponent and enjoy the classic game in an interactive format.  

## **Live Demo**

## **Features**  
- Two-player mode to play with a friend.  
- Simple, user-friendly interface.  
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile devices.  

## **How to Play**  
1. The game board has 9 squares in a 3x3 grid.  
2. Player 1 uses **X**, and Player 2 uses **O**.  
3. Players take turns placing their mark on an empty square.  
4. The first player to align three marks (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.  
5. If all squares are filled and no player wins, itâ€™s a draw.
